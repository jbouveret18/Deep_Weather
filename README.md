# Deep Learning Project : Weather prediction and sky image generation
As part of this project, we wanted to create a model that would predict the weather for the next few hours based on the previous hours for certain cities in Turkey. 
In addition to this, we wanted to generate an image of the sky representing the weather in relation to the predicted weather readings.

### ---------------------REQUIREMENTS---------------------

As a python project, please dowload all the required libraries listed in requirements.txt with the command : 

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
### ---------------------DATA---------------------

In this project, there are two deeplearning models to train.
For the first model, the data comes from [https://open-meteo.com/](https://open-meteo.com/).\
For the second model, the data comes from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather)

The API call is already implemented.\
For the second model:
1. Download the data from the link
2. Extract it in the file "./images"
3. Rename file "0" by "cloudy"
4. Rename file "1" by "rain"
5. Rename file "2" by "shine"
